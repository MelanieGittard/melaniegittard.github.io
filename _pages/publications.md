 * __[MiningLeaks: Water Pollution and Child Mortality in Africa](../files/GITTARD_HU2023.pdf)__, (with [Irène Hu](https://hu-irene.github.io/))
 
Industrial mining can be a boon or a bane for communities living in the vicinity of production sites. We assess the environmental and health impacts of industrial mining in Africa using micro-data from 1986 to 2018 in 26 countries matched with geocoded data of industrial mining sites. Through a staggered difference-in-difference strategy, we exploit the variation of the opening of a mine and the relative topographic position of surrounding villages. Relying on an upstream-downstream topographic treatment, we show that opening an industrial mining site increases infant mortality and that this effect is driven by mining-induced water pollution.

    <p align="justify"> This paper studies the effects of the increase in droughts occurrence on internal migration in Kenya. I build a panel of 2,518 sublocations using three exhaustive censuses in 1989, 1999, and 2009, matched with high-resolution rainfall data (CHIRPS). Using a two-way fixed effect model, I compare the demographic growth of sublocations according to the number of dry-rainy seasons over each decade. An additional drought decreases the demographic growth rate by 1.7 p.p, equivalent to a 1% population loss. The result holds for the [15; 65] years old cohort, which rules out other demographic effects and shows that the result is driven by migration. Migration occurs mainly in rural areas dominated by pastoralist activities. The main contribution is the heterogeneity analysis across gender, age, educational level, and economic activity, which identifies different forms of migration across livelihoods. It suggests a rural-rural migration of entire households of herders with little heterogeneity, in line with migration being a last resort solution. Agriculture-oriented rural areas are less vulnerable to droughts and display significant heterogeneity. Results show the migration of the most educated individuals in the working age, while unskilled individuals are trapped in affected areas. This paper is in line with rural-rural migration, as results suggest out-migration from rural pastoralist to rural agriculture-oriented areas with humid conditions. The results are robust to using binary treatment, correcting for negative weights, accounting for spurious correlation, and to randomization inference tests.

 * __[Impacts of repetitive droughts and the key role of experience : evidence from Nigeria](../files/GITTARD2023_Nigeria.pdf)__

    <p align="justify"> Western African Sahel faced severe droughts in the 1980s, affecting agricultural production and food security. In recent decades, farmers have faced uncertainty in the timing and amount of rainy seasons and are confronted with erratic rainfall with high interannual variations. Can the experience of past dry events reduce the vulnerability of households to short-term rainfall shocks? In this paper, I match three waves of panel household surveys focusing on agriculture in Nigeria (GHS, from 2010-2016) and high temporal resolution precipitation data set from the Climate Hazard Center (CHIRPS). I show evidence of the extreme importance of the long-dry period of the 1980s and identify more recent droughts in 2013/2015, which are in line with a change in the characteristics of the rainfall trends. Through a two-way-fixed effect strategy, I exploit the spatial variation of the exposition to the 2015 drought. First, I look at the short-term effects of being hit by a drought on agricultural production and food security indicators. I show that being hit by a drought decreases yields by 14%, and decreases the food diversity of households by around 1%. Second, I look at the impacts’ heterogeneity according to the plot’s experience, using the timing of the year of acquisition of the plot. I compare short-term droughts’ effects on households that acquired their first plot before the 1980s dry period to those that acquired it after. Results suggest that acquiring the land before 1985 attenuates the harmful effects of a climate shock, as these particular households have only a 3% reduction in their yields due to the 2015 drought. This is especially the case when households were severely hit in the 1980s. This result is only descriptive and can not lead to any causal interpretation. It might suggest that having a long-lasting experience under extreme dry events on cultivated land reduces vulnerability to rainfall variability.
